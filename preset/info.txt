 Presets
=========

This folder is used to store preset files. The bare filename without
extension determines the preset name avaiable in the Image Configuration
Dialog. The values within the preset file are stored in a simple json
format.

Preset files are holding image and storage information that can be 
loaded from within the Image Configuration Dialog. The stored preset
values are overriding all editable values in the current Image
Configuration Dialog.

The content of the current Image Configuration Dialog can be stored
as preset file in this location as well.
